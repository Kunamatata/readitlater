Nuff said.\r\n\r\nAdvertisement\nArtist: Inaba Koshi\r\n\r\nWhy I Love It: This song makes Detective Conan seem way more epic than the formulaic mystery it actually is.\r\n\r\nAnime: Active Raid \nArtist: AKINO with bless4\r\n\r\nWhy I Love It: I\u2019ve come to the realization that I\u2019m going to like every AKINO song I come across. Her belting soprano voice gets me every time.\r\n\r\nAnime: Durarara!!x2 Ketsu\nArtist: FLOW\r\n\r\nWhy I Love It: Not only is the song great, but the opening introduces all the important characters by name as well. Then it gives you a brief recap mid-song that reminds you of important moments from previous episodes that are vital to what you\u2019re about to watch.\r\n\r\nAnime: Erased\nArtist: ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION\r\n\r\nWhy I Love It: The tone of the song manages to capture both the everyday life nature of the show as well as the looming threat lying just beneath the surface.\r\n\r\nAnime: Bubuki Buranki\nWhy I Love It: Good use of female vocals, a hard guitar, and autotune.\r\n\r\nAnime: Ajin\nSong: \u201cHOW CLOSE YOU ARE\u201d\r\n\r\nArtist: Miyano Mamoru\r\n\r\nWhy I Love It: This is a rather laid-back ballad offset with images of Ajin dying hauntingly in a beautiful art style.\r\n\r\nKotaku East is your slice of Asian internet culture, bringing you the latest talking points from Japan, Korea, China and beyond.

The game\u2019s 2014 predecessor, Bravely Default, already let players lower (or raise) the frequency of random encounters on the fly. Unfortunately, the original game also required players to replay major sections of the game up to five times before getting a proper ending. That\u2019s player-hostile, huh?\r\n\r\n The downloadable demo, which serves as a standalone prologue to next month\u2019s full release of Bravely Second, has these two player-friendly ideas that enliven its turn-based fights:\r\n\r\nAdvertisement\nI\u2019ll make it to a third victory here. My best streak is seven.\r\n\r\n\u201cBring It On!\u201d Battles - Many JRPGs will suck you into a random battle against weak enemies even if your party\u2019s characters are so powerful that they can swat those enemies into dust in one turn. This wastes your time. Bravely Second\u2019s designers, however, have found a way to turn this cliche into a compelling, strategic situation. Sure, you are uber-powered enough to beat one set of enemies in one turn, but can your four-person party beat a second wave in one turn? Yeah? How about a third? In the demo (and presumably in the game), you will be offered the chance to summon a second wave of enemies, if you wipe the first out in one turn. Do the same to the second wave and you can call in a third, a fourth and so on. You fail if you lose the fight or, more likely, if you simply need two or more turns to beat the newest wave of bad guys.\r\n\r\nEach successive one-round battle adds a multiplier to the experience and money rewards you get at the end of the battle, so stacking your one-round wins is worthwhile. It\u2019s also difficult to stack them, because your party will likely dwindle the more waves you summon. Many of the best attacks available to members of your party will cost them a \u201cbrave point\u201d and make them ineligible until a second turn of a given fight. Since you\u2019re trying to wipe out each enemy wave in one turn, a character who is down brave points can\u2019t be used and will leave you with fewer and fewer party members eligible to attack in the next round.\r\n\r\nSponsored\r\n\r\nYou follow? This turns what would be a mismatch waste of the player\u2019s time in other RPGs into a series of increasingly tricky battles that require shrewd party management. They pay worthwhile rewards, too.\r\n\r\nAn Encyclopedia That Expands As You Beat The Same Enemies - The first Bravely game, like many RPGs, includes dossiers on the enemies you defeat. The Bravely Second demo betters that by filling out more of the entries as you defeat more of the same kind of enemy.\r\n\r\nYour first encounter with an enemy will add a nice drawing and some basic info about the evil creature to your \u201cbestiary.\u201d Subsequent encounters gradually unlock a conversation that your party members have about that type of enemy. This bit of enemy-focused banter fleshes out your party\u2019s personalities and riffs on the game\u2019s good enemy designs. More importantly, it provides a trickle of narrative reward, a welcome bonus, given that RPGs basically have to keep making you fight the same goblin\/harpy\/undead\/etc grunt enemies in battle after battle. You might as well get an unfolding mini-story tied to each enemy for your efforts.\r\n\r\nI bailed on the original Bravely Default after six hours because I didn\u2019t want to deal with a game that has such a severe amount of late-game grind. That game had a fun battle system, great art and some funny writing, but time-waste design elements like forcing players to repeat the same stuff over and over again aren\u2019t for me.\r\n\r\nAdvertisement\r\n\r\nI have, however, happily played more than six hours of Bravely Second\u2019s demo. It\u2019s mostly like the last game and even brings back some old characters (one of whom is now a... sexily dressed pope, of course). It lets you sample some of the game\u2019s available jobs, go on a few quests, fight a boss and have some good, free fun. I recommend it even if you don\u2019t plan to get the full Bravely Second game next month. Whether you do or don\u2019t, the demo won\u2019t waste your time. \nMeanwhile in Japan, Microsoft's A.I.

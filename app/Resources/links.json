Nuff said.\r\n\r\nAdvertisement\nArtist: Inaba Koshi\r\n\r\nWhy I Love It: This song makes Detective Conan seem way more epic than the formulaic mystery it actually is.\r\n\r\nAnime: Active Raid \nArtist: AKINO with bless4\r\n\r\nWhy I Love It: I\u2019ve come to the realization that I\u2019m going to like every AKINO song I come across. Her belting soprano voice gets me every time.\r\n\r\nAnime: Durarara!!x2 Ketsu\nArtist: FLOW\r\n\r\nWhy I Love It: Not only is the song great, but the opening introduces all the important characters by name as well. Then it gives you a brief recap mid-song that reminds you of important moments from previous episodes that are vital to what you\u2019re about to watch.\r\n\r\nAnime: Erased\nArtist: ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION\r\n\r\nWhy I Love It: The tone of the song manages to capture both the everyday life nature of the show as well as the looming threat lying just beneath the surface.\r\n\r\nAnime: Bubuki Buranki\nWhy I Love It: Good use of female vocals, a hard guitar, and autotune.\r\n\r\nAnime: Ajin\nSong: \u201cHOW CLOSE YOU ARE\u201d\r\n\r\nArtist: Miyano Mamoru\r\n\r\nWhy I Love It: This is a rather laid-back ballad offset with images of Ajin dying hauntingly in a beautiful art style.\r\n\r\nKotaku East is your slice of Asian internet culture, bringing you the latest talking points from Japan, Korea, China and beyond.
